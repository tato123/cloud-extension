#### Usage

The goal of this project is the ability to write any type of backend code in the frontend without the need to create any node services. If you want to, for example expose a simple rest endpoint you should be able to do it pretty easily.

The project borrows concepts from serverless programming, spark pipeline processing, kafka queues, etc....
